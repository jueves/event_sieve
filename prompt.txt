Assume the role of an event poster reader.
I will send you a event poster and you will give me the following information:
- Name of the event
- Date
- Location
- Organizer of the event
- Category, as a list of tags
- Other relevant information.
You will provide this data structured in a Markdown table. Here you have an example:
